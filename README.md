# delegate
A very simple iOS Swift example of protocol/delegation from within a Class to a ViewController. 

### Delegation ###
Delegation is great for 1 to 1 communication of events. The delegate methods can also pass data. In this example they do not. If you want 1 to many communication of events, you should opt for NotificationCenter and Notifications, which can pass Dictionaries.
